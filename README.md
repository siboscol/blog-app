# Simo's Simple Blog

Simple Blog App built with NodeJs (Express) and VueJs (Quasar).  
This web app consists of a server (nodejs) and a client (Quasar) with actual storage and the data are mocked in json file (server/api/data/posts.json).  
The backend provides APIs for:
- Get all posts
- Get/create a post
- Get all comments for a specific post
- Get/Create/Update a comment

The frontend provides a:  
- Homepage with a list of posts and comments total
- Post page with title/blody and a list of comments
    - it's possible to create/edit a comment
- About page with my current CV

The app provides unit tests for both server and client, together with a dockerfile to run it in a container.
## Getting Started

Get started developing...

```shell
# install dependencies
npm install

# run in development mode
npm run dev

# run tests
npm run test
```

## Install Dependencies

Install all package dependencies (one time operation)

```shell
npm install
```

## Run It
#### Run in *development* mode:
Runs the application is development mode. Should not be used in production

```shell
npm run dev
```

or debug it

```shell
npm run dev:debug
```

#### Run in *production* mode:

Compiles the application and starts it in production production mode.

```shell
npm run compile
npm start
```

#### Run it in a docker container
In this `Dockerfile` the nodejs server and quasar client are together in the same container although it's definitely possible to have them separately by creating 2 different dockerfiles where the quasar client will served by an nginx web server (https://vuejs.org/v2/cookbook/dockerize-vuejs-app.html) and the nodejs server follows the same stage as in the current dockerfile.

```
# Build the docker image
docker build -t blog-image .
#Â Run the container
docker run -it -p 3000:3000 --name blog-container blog-image
```
* Open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* In order to the APIs documentation go to [http://localhost:3000/api-explorer/](http://localhost:3000/api-explorer/)

## Test It

Run the Mocha unit tests

```shell
npm test
```

or debug them

```shell
npm run test:debug
```

## Try It
* Open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* In order to see all endpoints and to test them go to [http://localhost:3000/api-explorer/](http://localhost:3000/api-explorer/)


## Debug It

#### Debug the server:

```
npm run dev:debug
```

#### Debug Tests

```
npm run test:debug
```

#### Debug with VSCode

On the `launch.json` file there are configurations to attach to a process, debug the tests and debug the server.

In order to debug the server and obtain prettier logs, install globally pino-pretty:
```
yarn global add pino-pretty
```
## Lint It

View prettier linter output

```
npm run lint
```

Fix all prettier linter errors

```
npm run lint
```
